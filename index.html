        <p>The North American Brown Bear is freakin' awesome. They are apex in the food chain. Big balls of muscle
            and fur that you do not want to be on the wrong side of. Being able to kick the butt of nearly all competition
            has allowed these magnificant creatures become stay super chill. In their free time these bears like to spend time
            with their fam, go fishing, and then hibernate for a quarter of the year. Don't judge. They need their beauty sleep.
            Bears are cool. Bears. Beets. and Battle Star galatica. Yep this has been a very uninformative data dump.
            I hope you enjoyed.
